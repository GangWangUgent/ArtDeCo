Welcome to ArtDeCo!

The ArtDeCo is short for 'Artemia Detection and Counting' dataset. Artemia is a genus of aquatic crustaceans used as live diet for fish. 
This dataset is mainly developed for creating effective and efficient methods for processing high-throughput images of Artemia obtained by microscope. 

This is a challenging task because of the following reasons:
(1) The objects sometimes have a high degree of adjacency.
(2) The scales of the objects vary significantly over different images.
(3) There are artefacts in the background.


The full dataset consists of three parts: marker dataset, classification dataset and test dataset.
(1) The marker dataset is used for training the marker proposal network, which indicates the main body of candidate objects.
(2) The classification dataset is used for training a classifier categorizing the candidates into different classes.
(3) The test dataset is used for evaluating the performance of Artemia detection and counting.
