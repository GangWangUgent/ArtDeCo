In this folder, you can find the source code of the proposed Marker-CNN that might be published soon. This method combines a marker proposal network with a classifier. 
The marker proposal network is used to indicate target candidates, while the classifier further categorizes the candidates into different classes.
Based on the experimental validation, the Marker-CNN shows advantages in separating adjacent objects over the competing methods.
